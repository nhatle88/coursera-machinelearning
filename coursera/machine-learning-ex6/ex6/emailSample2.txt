Hey there,
We are reaching out to all Fabric customers today with an important final reminder that Fabric is shutting down Ma‌y 4, 2020. After this date, you’ll no longer have access to the Fabric dashboard and your Fabric app data will be deleted in accordance with the Fabric Data Processing and Security Terms.
If you haven’t already, make sure to migrate your Fabric apps to Firebase before Ma‌y 4, 2020. Migrating is quick and easy, and only takes a few minutes.
Migrate to Firebase
As always, our team is here to support you however we can. Reach out to support@fabric.io and we’ll be happy to help.
With Fabric shutting down, we are excited to dedicate all of our time and effort to Firebase. We are heads down working on new tools and features to make Firebase your go-to platform for building and monitoring your apps. Our mission has, and will always be, to help you and your team succeed.
Here's to the end of an era and to the beginning of a bright new one.
Sincerely,
